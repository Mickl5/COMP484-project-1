                    Manchester United was born in 1878 as <strong>Newton Heath LYR Football Club</strong>, 
                    founded by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. 
                    For the first fifteen years, the team was literally "The Railwaymen," playing on a bleak, 
                    bumpy pitch at North Road. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1892, the club formally severed ties with the railway company, dropped the "LYR" 
                    from their name, and moved to Bank Street, but life as an independent club was a 
                    constant battle for survival.

        <div class="history-content">
            <p>
                By 1902, the club was legally bankrupt. The turning point was a four-day 
                fundraiser where the club captain, Harry Stafford, lost his St. Bernard dog, Major. 
                The dog was found by <strong>John Henry Davies</strong>, a local brewery owner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this chance encounter, Davies met Stafford and decided to invest in the club. 
                He insisted on a complete rebrand; on April 26, 1902, the colors were changed to Red and White, 
                and the name <strong>Manchester&nbsp;United</strong> was born, narrowly beating out "Manchester Central" 
                and "Manchester Celtic" as the new title. We then won the first of our 20 English League titles in 1908 and, 
                in 1910, we moved to Old Trafford, our current stadium.

        <div class="history-text">
            <p>
                Following World War II, <strong>Sir Matt Busby</strong> 
                transformed Manchester United by building a team of "wonderkids" promoted from the youth ranks. 
                Known as the <strong>Busby Babes</strong>, this squad—led by the phenomenal Duncan Edwards,
                 still regarded as possibly Englands best talent, captured the 1956 and 1957 league titles, 
                 playing an attacking brand of football that captivated the world and challenged the European elite.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club's rapid ascent was tragically halted on <strong>February 6, 1958</strong>,
                by the Munich Air Disaster. While returning from a European Cup match, the team's plane crashed, 
                claiming 23 lives, including eight players. Busby survived despite being hospitalised for severe injuries, 
                and goalkeeper Harry Gregg became known as the "Angel of Belgrade" for pulling teammates from the burning wreckage.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "United will rise again." 
                <cite>— Sir Matt Busby (Spoken during his recovery)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Busby spent the next decade fulfilling that promise. 
                He built a new side around Munich survivors Bobby Charlton and Bill Foulkes, 
                adding the legendary flair of George Best and Denis Law. This <strong>"Holy Trinity"</strong> 
                eventually led United to a 4-1 victory over Benfica at Wembley in the 1968 European Cup final,
                 making them the first English club to win the trophy, exactly ten years after Munich.

            <p>
                After <strong>Sir Matt Busby</strong> retired in 1969,
                 the club entered a difficult period of transition and relative decline. 
                 Although United remained a massive cultural force and enjoyed occasional success, 
                 such as winning the <strong>FA Cup</strong> in 1977, 1983, and 1985, they lacked consistency in the league.
                  For nearly two decades, 
                  the club lived in the shadow of Liverpool's domestic dominance and even suffered a brief relegation to the
                   <strong>Second Division</strong> in 1974. The team was often described as a "cup side,"
                   capable of brilliant one-off performances but unable to sustain a title challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything changed on <strong>November 6, 1986</strong>,
                 with the appointment of <strong>Alex Ferguson</strong> from Aberdeen.
                  His early years were famously difficult, as he sought to overhaul the club's scouting, youth systems,
                   and discipline. The turning point finally arrived with an <strong>FA Cup</strong> win in 1990,
                   followed by the <strong>European Cup Winners' Cup</strong> in 1991. By the <strong>1992-93 season</strong>,
                    Ferguson led United to the inaugural <strong>Premier League</strong> title, 
                    ending the club's agonizing 26-year wait for a league championship and signaling the start of a new dynasty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pinnacle of Ferguson's tenure came in the <strong>1998-99 season</strong>.
                 Building a team around the <strong>"Class of '92,"</strong> homegrown talents like <strong>David Beckham</strong>,
                  <strong>Paul Scholes</strong>, <strong>Ryan Giggs</strong>, and the <strong>Neville brothers</strong>,
                   Ferguson achieved the impossible by winning <strong>The Treble</strong>. 
                   After securing the <strong>Premier League</strong> and the <strong>FA Cup</strong>,
                    United completed the feat with two injury-time goals against
                     <strong>Bayern Munich</strong> in the <strong>Champions League</strong> final. 
                     While local rivals Manchester City have since matched this achievement,
                      United's 1999 campaign remains the first time an English club secured those three specific trophies
                       in a single season.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the Treble, 
                Ferguson continued to evolve the squad, eventually building another world-conquering side led by
                 the explosive duo of <strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> and <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>. 
                 Joining as teenagers, they became the focal point of a team that dominated the late 2000s. 
                 <strong>Rooney's</strong> aggression and selflessness perfectly complemented <strong>Ronaldo's</strong>
                  unmatched flair and goal-scoring prowess. 
                  Together, they led United to <strong>three consecutive Premier&nbsp;League&nbsp;titles</strong>
                   between 2007 and 2009 and another <strong>Champions League</strong> trophy in 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time <strong>Sir Alex</strong> retired in 2013,
                 he had secured a staggering <strong>13 Premier League titles</strong>, <strong>2 Champions Leagues</strong>, 
                 and <strong>5 FA Cups</strong>. He retired as the most successful manager in the history of British football,
                  having famously fulfilled his early promise:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their f*****g perch. And you can print that."
                <cite>— Sir Alex Ferguson</cite>
